There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a direct friend of B, and B is a direct friend of C, then A is an indirect friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.

Given a N*N matrix M representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M[i][j] = 1, then the ith and jth students are direct friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.

```java
    
    //You can also do DFS - connected components 
    //Time O(n2)
    //space - O(n)
    
    public void dfs(int[][] M, boolean[] visited, int i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M.length; j++) {
            if (M[i][j] == 1 && !visited[j]) {
                visited[j] = true;
                dfs(M, visited, j);
            }
        }
    }
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] M) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[M.length];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < M.length; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(M, visited, i);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
